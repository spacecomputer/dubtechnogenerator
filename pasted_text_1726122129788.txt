What am I going to do? I'm going to write a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) specification for InfinityScore AI, focusing on the core features and essential functionality that can be developed and tested in a shorter timeframe.

MVP Specification for InfinityScore AI

1. Product Overview:
The MVP of InfinityScore AI will be a streamlined version of the full product, focusing on core functionality of real-time music generation responsive to basic game events. This version will serve as a proof of concept and allow for initial user testing and feedback.

2. Core MVP Features:

2.1 Basic Infinite Music Generation:
   - Generate continuous background music for up to 1 hour without obvious repetition
   - Maintain consistent style and mood throughout the generation
   - Implement simple transitions between musical sections

2.2 Real-time Composition:
   - Generate music in real-time at 44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo
   - Support for a single stereo output stream (no multi-track)
   - Latency of less than 500ms for music generation

2.3 Limited Game Event Reactivity:
   - Integrate with one major game engine (e.g., Unity)
   - Respond to three basic game events: start game, enter combat, end game
   - Modify tempo and intensity based on these events

2.4 Simple Mood Adaptation:
   - Support two distinct moods: calm and intense
   - Allow manual switching between these moods
   - Implement gradual transition between mood states

3. Technical Specifications:

3.1 AI Models:
   - Utilize pre-trained MusicVAE model from Magenta
   - Implement basic Music Transformer model for local coherence
   - No custom-trained models for the MVP

3.2 Audio Synthesis:
   - Use basic software synthesis for a limited set of instruments (e.g., piano, strings, percussion)
   - Implement simple audio mixing for generated tracks

3.3 Performance:
   - Optimize for running on a standard desktop computer (i5 processor or equivalent, 8GB RAM)
   - Generate at least 30 seconds of music in advance to ensure smooth playback

3.4 Integration:
   - Develop a simple REST API for receiving game events
   - Create a basic SDK for Unity integration

4. User Interface:

4.1 Developer Console:
   - Command-line interface for starting and stopping the music generation
   - Basic logging of generation events and errors

4.2 Game Integration UI:
   - Simple in-game toggle for turning adaptive music on/off
   - Volume control for generated music

5. Customization:
   - Allow basic parameter adjustments (e.g., tempo range, instrument selection) via configuration file

6. Data Management:
   - Local storage of generated music samples for analysis
   - No user data collection in MVP

7. Security:
   - Basic API key authentication for accessing the music generation service

8. Documentation:
   - README file with setup instructions and basic API documentation
   - Simple integration guide for Unity developers

9. MVP Development Phases:

Phase 1: Core Generation (2 weeks)
- Set up Magenta environment
- Implement basic infinite music generation
- Develop simple synthesis engine

Phase 2: Game Integration (2 weeks)
- Create REST API for game events
- Develop Unity SDK
- Implement basic mood and event reactivity

Phase 3: UI and Optimization (1 week)
- Develop command-line interface
- Optimize performance for target hardware
- Create basic in-game controls

Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (1 week)
- Conduct internal testing
- Fix critical bugs
- Prepare documentation

Total MVP Development Time: 6 weeks

10. Success Criteria:
- Continuous music generation for 1 hour without obvious repetition
- Successful integration with a sample Unity game
- Noticeable music adaptation to basic game events
- Performance capable of real-time generation on target hardware
- Positive feedback from initial developer testing

11. Limitations and Future Improvements:
- Limited instrument variety and music complexity
- No viewer interaction features in MVP
- Basic mood system with room for expansion
- No cloud-based or distributed processing
- Future versions will include more sophisticated AI models, broader game engine support, and viewer interaction features

This MVP specification outlines a achievable initial version of InfinityScore AI that demonstrates the core concept of adaptive, AI-generated game music. It prioritizes essential features while setting the stage for future enhancements based on user feedback and further development.
