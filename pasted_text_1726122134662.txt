Product Specifications Definition

Product Name: InfinityScore AI

1. Product Overview:
InfinityScore AI is a proprietary artificial intelligence engine that generates infinite, real-time music for interactive media, particularly video games and live streaming platforms. The system uses advanced machine learning models to compose and perform music dynamically, responding to game events and viewer input in real-time.

2. Core Features:

2.1 Infinite Music Generation:
   - Continuously generates original music without repetition or breaks
   - Maintains musical coherence and structure over extended periods
   - Seamlessly transitions between musical sections

2.2 Real-time Composition:
   - Generates music on-the-fly, without pre-rendered audio files
   - Adapts to changing game states or viewer inputs within milliseconds
   - Supports multiple simultaneous instrumental tracks

2.3 Game Event Reactivity:
   - Integrates with game engines to receive real-time event data
   - Modifies musical elements (tempo, mood, intensity) based on game events
   - Supports custom event mapping for different game genres

2.4 Viewer Interaction:
   - Accepts input from viewers/players to influence music generation
   - Implements a voting or preference system for collaborative music shaping
   - Provides API for integration with streaming platforms and chat systems

2.5 Adaptive Mood and Style:
   - Dynamically adjusts musical mood to match game atmosphere
   - Supports multiple genre styles (e.g., orchestral, electronic, ambient)
   - Allows for smooth transitions between different moods and styles

3. Technical Specifications:

3.1 AI Models:
   - Primary composition model: Custom-trained MusicVAE (Magenta)
   - Local coherence model: Fine-tuned Music Transformer (Magenta)
   - Instrument performance models: Separate models for each instrument type

3.2 Audio Synthesis:
   - Real-time synthesis engine for high-quality instrument simulation
   - Support for virtual instruments and sample-based synthesis
   - Low-latency audio processing (< 10ms)

3.3 Performance:
   - Capable of generating at least 60 seconds of music in advance
   - Supports real-time generation at 44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo
   - Optimized for multi-core CPU utilization and GPU acceleration

3.4 Scalability:
   - Supports simultaneous generation for multiple game instances or streams
   - Cloud-ready architecture for distributed processing
   - Automatic load balancing for high-demand scenarios

3.5 Integration:
   - RESTful API for game engine integration
   - WebSocket support for real-time communication
   - SDK for major game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine)

4. User Interface:

4.1 Developer Console:
   - Web-based interface for system monitoring and control
